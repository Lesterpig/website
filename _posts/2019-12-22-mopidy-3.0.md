The long-awaited Mopidy 3.0 is finally here, just in time for the Mopidy
project's 10th anniversary on December 23rd!

Mopidy 3.0 is a backward-incompatible release in a pretty significant way:
Mopidy no longer runs on Python 2.

<!-- more -->

**Mopidy 3.0 requires Python 3.7 or newer.**

While extensions have been able to continue working without changes
throughout the 1.x and 2.x series of Mopidy, this time is different:

- All extensions must be updated to work on Python 3.7 and newer.

- Some extensions need to replace their use of a few long-deprecated APIs
  that we've removed.
  See [the full changelog](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/changelog/)
  for details.

- Extension maintainers are also encouraged to update their project's setup to
  match our refreshed
  [extension cookiecutter](https://github.com/mopidy/cookiecutter-mopidy-ext).

In parallel with the development of Mopidy 3.0, we've coordinated with a few
extension maintainers and upgraded almost 20 of the most popular extensions.
These will all be published shortly after the release of Mopidy 3.0.

We've also built a new [extension registry](/ext/), where you can quickly track
what extensions are ready for Python 3.

In other news, the [Mopidy-MPD](/ext/mpd/) and [Mopidy-Local](/ext/local/)
extensions have grown up and moved out to flourish as independent extension
projects. After the move, Mopidy-Local merged with Mopidy-Local-SQLite and
Mopidy-Local-Images, which are now both a part of the Mopidy-Local extension.

For further details,
please see [the changelog](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/changelog/).
